Core Tenets:
- Games are long term
  - Potential for multiple game speeds (1 day hyper, 1 week rapid, 1 month standard, etc)
- Strategy is more important than activity
  - 1 login every 12 hours with well-thought-out plans is enough to stay competitive
- Multiple playstyles supported
  - Attacker
  - Defender/Expander
  - Thief
  - Support
  - Leader
- Clear, accessible, and relevant information is available at every decision-making point
- Individual players will not perform as well as team players
- Real-time (<= 1 second ticks or continuous formula-based)
- Multiple tiers of politics
  - Local - decisions made to impact immediate team
  - Regional - decisions made to impact groups of teams
  - Universal - decisions made to impact all players
- Community-driven elements
- Minor comeback mechanics to slow down top players/teams from pulling away
  - High-performing players/teams should be able to overcome these mechanics
  - Early game-end conditions if a player/team exceeds certain thresholds
- Humans preferred over bots, but bots will be used to meet minimum player counts
- Leaderboards/achievements prioritize mid-round contributions over end-round snapshots
- Moderate information obscurity:
  - Intended to mitigate external program support
  - Outside programs should not be able to outperform human decisions
  - If information is only accessible through an external program, it should be reworked to be made available to all/none of the players
- Simplicity of play is preferred to complexity
  - Features/complexity should only be added if they are net positive for other core tenets

Nice to have, but not for v1.0:
- Graphical UI
- Built-in chat (let's not reinvent discord)

Novel ideas:
- Real time
- Universal voting system to boost/penalize certain mechanics - buy votes with money
- Schedule spying/attacking ahead of time
- Sector leaders:
  - Sector leaders forfeit their kingdom (or only their offense?) but can leverage pooled military from the sector to make attacks/defending/spying
  - Gains from sector leaders are distributed to the sector, in a method voted on by the sector
  - Sector leaders can accept requests to control a single kingdom temporarily
- Empire leaders (emporers)
  - Empires can designate war targets with special options for distributing gains
    - For example, a fuel sabotage target with 20% cut will distribute 20% of conquered gains proportionally to kingdoms that sabotaged in the past ~24 hours
  - Empire leaders gain votes for Universal Congress based on their total land/score
- Spying
  - Share military intel with sectormates with a requested cut (10% of gains or configurable)
  - Spying on military/settlements lasts for a period of time, rather than being a snapshot
  - More options for kingdom interaction:
    - Increase return times for X hours
	- Increase spy mission cooldowns
- Fog of war
  - Sectors have fog of war until revealed (other than KD names)
  - Kingdoms that have attacked one of your sector's kingdoms causes their sector's high-level stats to be revealed for 24 hours
  - Kingdoms that have aggro-spied (steals, sabotages) on you have their high-level stats revealed for 24 hours
  - Sectors can be revealed at random for cheaper than revealing specific sectors
  - You can only spy on a sector/KD if they've been revealed (maybe?)
- Projects (research)
  - Continuous projects will have less aggressive scaling (between land^1.0 and land^1.5)
  - Spy cooldown reduction (continuous project)
  - Unlock extra spy missions
  - Maybe some wacky end-game project to remove all fog-of-war
Convenience:
  - Manually/Automatically attack "primitives" at a 3x the median defense per land (food attack simplification)
  - Automatically rob primitives at 1/3 the median income (food rob simplification)
Recovery from attacks:
  - Buildings are not instantly destroyed, but decay over time until at land
  - Some defeated units become injured and can be recovered in hospitals
RPG-esque:
  - Generals have unique abilities/names
Missiles:
  - More granular build amounts
  - Requires a dedicated building to construct
